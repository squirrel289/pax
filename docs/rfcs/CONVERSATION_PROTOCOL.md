# Conversation Protocol

This file is a compatibility shim.

The canonical RFC interaction protocol is:

- `docs/rfcs/INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`

Rules:

- Implementations MUST follow `INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md` when both files are present.
- This file SHOULD remain a stable redirect to avoid broken references.
