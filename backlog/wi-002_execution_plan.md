- ❌ Memory layer aggregation (deferred to wi-003)
- ❌ Signal evolution and pattern extraction (deferred to wi-005)
- ❌ VS Code extension integration (already completed in wi-001)
- ❌ creating-skill workflow implementation (deferred to wi-006)
- ❌ User-facing UI/commands (minimal CLI for testing only)

### Critical Dependencies

## Validation Signals

### Functional Validation

1. **Event Capture**:
   - Signal: Create test file → event captured in episodes.jsonl with type="file_create"
   - Signal: Run terminal command → event captured with type="terminal_execute"
   - Signal: Trigger diagnostic → event captured with type="diagnostic"
   - Command: `python implementation.py --capture file_create --input test.txt`

2. **Storage Integrity**:
   - Signal: Each event is valid JSON line (newline-delimited)
   - Signal: Events persist across skill invocations
   - Signal: No data corruption after concurrent writes
   - Command: `python -c "import json; [json.loads(line) for line in open('.vscode/pax-memory/episodes.jsonl')]"`

3. **TTL Cleanup**:
   - Signal: Events older than 7 days are removed
   - Signal: Recent events preserved after cleanup
   - Command: `python implementation.py --cleanup --dry-run`

### Test Validation

- Signal: `pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term` shows ≥80% coverage
- Signal: All tests pass (no failures, no warnings)
- Signal: Test execution time <5 seconds (unit tests should be fast)

### Integration Validation

- Signal: Background mode runs without errors for 5 minutes
- Signal: Provider facade detects "universal" as default
- Signal: Event schema validates all required fields (timestamp, provider, event_type, metadata)

4. Implement facade.py with auto-detection (4h)
5. Implement jsonl_handler.py with TTL cleanup (6h)

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests (≥80% coverage required)

- **Event Schema Tests** (test_event_capture.py):
  - Valid event creation with all required fields
  - Invalid event rejection (missing fields, wrong types)
  - Event serialization to JSON
  - EventType enum validation

- **Provider Tests** (test_event_capture.py):
  - Universal provider file watcher (mock filesystem events)
  - Terminal listener (mock terminal output)
  - Diagnostic collector (mock VS Code diagnostics)
  - Skill tracker (mock skill invocations)

- **Storage Tests** (test_storage.py):
  - JSONL append without corruption
  - Concurrent write handling (threading test)
  - TTL cleanup (synthetic old events)
  - Read operations (all events, filter by type, date range)

### Manual Integration Tests

- Background mode: Start capture, perform 10+ workspace actions, verify all captured
- Provider detection: Run on different assistants, verify correct provider selected
- Storage persistence: Capture events, restart extension, verify events still exist

### Performance Benchmarks

- Event capture latency: <10ms per event
- JSONL write throughput: ≥100 events/second
- TTL cleanup: <1 second for 1000 events
- Background mode CPU: <1% average usage

### External Dependencies

- **Python 3.8+**: Standard library only (no external packages for Phase 1)
- **VS Code Extension**: Already implemented in wi-001 ✅
- **Local Storage**: .vscode/pax-memory/ created and git-ignored ✅

### Internal Dependencies

- **wi-001 (Extension Scaffolding)**: SATISFIED ✅
  - vscode-pax-feedback/ extension exists
  - TypeScript compiled successfully
  - Extension ready for integration

### Dependency Conflicts

- None identified - this is net-new skill implementation

## Workspace State Recording

### Pre-Implementation State

- **Branch**: main
- **Workspace**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Last Commit**: f5b9319 - "docs(rfcs): add decision-making skills consolidation RFC"
- **Python Environment**: System Python 3.x (no virtualenv needed for Phase 1)
- **VS Code Extension**: Compiled in vscode-pax-feedback/dist/

### Feature Branch State

- **Branch**: feature/wi-002-capture-events-skill (created from main)
- **Workspace**: Clean (ready for implementation)
- **Isolation**: Feature branch for atomic PR

### Out-of-Scope Work Protection

- No pending changes in other work items
- No conflicts with ongoing development
- All documentation updates isolated to wi-002 context

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **File Watcher Performance**: Watching large workspaces may cause high CPU
   - Mitigation: Debounce events, filter by file extension, exclude node_modules
2. **JSONL Corruption**: Concurrent writes may corrupt file
   - Mitigation: Use file locking, atomic writes, validation on read
3. **TTL Cleanup Race Condition**: Cleanup during write may lose events
   - Mitigation: Read-modify-write with lock, mark-and-sweep approach

### Process Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Temptation to add Copilot/Codex providers
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to scope boundaries, defer to wi-004
2. **Test Coverage**: May not reach 80% threshold
   - Mitigation: TDD approach, write tests before implementation
3. **Integration Complexity**: VS Code extension integration untested
   - Mitigation: Manual integration testing in Phase 3
