# Resolve PR Comments

A workflow skill that systematically addresses and resolves all review comments on a pull request.

## Purpose

Automates the process of reviewing, addressing, and resolving PR review feedback by composing multiple general-purpose skills into a cohesive workflow.

## When to Use

Use this workflow when:

- PR has received review comments that need to be addressed
- You want to systematically work through all feedback
- You need to resolve threads after making changes
- PR is blocked on unresolved review comments

## Skill Composition

This workflow composes:

1. **pull-request-tool**: Fetch review comments, reply to threads, resolve threads
2. **sequential-execution** **OR** **parallel-execution**: Process comments in order (sequential) or concurrently (parallel), handle dependencies as needed
3. **yolo** OR **collaborative**: Execution mode (autonomous vs interactive)

## Parameters

### Required

You must specify the pull request to process using **either** of the following input formats:

- **Separate Parameters:**
        - **pr-number**: Pull request number (e.g., `42`)
        - **repository**: Repository in the format `owner/repo` (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`)

- **Combined URL:**
        - **pr-url**: Full pull request URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42`)

If both formats are provided, `pr-url` takes precedence.

### Optional

- **interaction-mode**: `yolo` (autonomous) or `collaborative` (interactive)
- **execution-mode**: `sequential` (default) or `parallel`
- **filter**: `unresolved-only` (default), `all`, `by-reviewer`
- **auto-resolve**: Automatically resolve threads after addressing (default: true)
- **reviewer**: Filter comments by specific reviewer

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Discovery

1. **Fetch PR details** (pull-request-tool)
     - Get PR metadata
     - Verify PR is open
     - Check current status

2. **List review comments** (pull-request-tool)
     - Get all review threads
     - Filter based on parameters
     - Group by file and thread

### Phase 2: Analysis

1. **Analyze comments** (sequential-execution OR parallel-execution)
     - Categorize by type (question, change request, suggestion)
     - Identify dependencies between comments
     - Prioritize or group for resolution

2. **Plan approach**
     - Determine which comments need code changes
     - Which need clarification/discussion
     - Which can be resolved with replies

### Phase 3: Resolution

1. **Address each comment** (sequential-execution OR parallel-execution)

     For each comment (in order or concurrently, based on execution-mode):

     a. **Review the feedback**
            - Read comment and context
            - Understand the request
            - Check referenced code

     b. **Determine action**
            - Code change needed?
            - Just needs reply/clarification?
            - Already addressed?

     c. **Take action**
            - Make code changes if needed
            - Reply to thread with explanation
            - Mark as resolved if appropriate

     d. **Verify resolution**
            - Ensure change addresses feedback
            - Run tests if code changed
            - Confirm reviewer intent met

### Phase 4: Finalization

1. **Push changes** (if any code changes made)
     - Commit all changes
     - Push to PR branch
     - Trigger CI checks

2. **Final verification**
     - Verify all targeted comments addressed
     - Check for any new comments
     - Update PR description if needed

## Interaction and Execution Modes

### YOLO Mode (Autonomous)

```markdown
When interaction-mode = yolo:
- Automatically determine best response to each comment
- Make code changes without confirmation
- Auto-resolve threads after addressing
- Report only final summary
```

### Collaborative Mode (Interactive)

```markdown
When interaction-mode = collaborative:
- Show each comment to user
- Propose response/change
- Get approval before proceeding
- Confirm before resolving threads
```

### Sequential vs Parallel Execution

- **sequential**: Comments are processed one after another, respecting dependencies.
- **parallel**: Independent comments are processed concurrently for faster resolution.

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: YOLO + Parallel

```markdown
Task: Resolve all unresolved PR comments on PR #42 in owner/repo using parallel execution

Execution:
1. Fetch unresolved comments (5 found)
2. Process all comments in parallel:
     - Comment 1: "Add error handling" → Add try/catch, reply, resolve
     - Comment 2: "Fix typo" → Fix, reply, resolve
     - ...
3. Push changes
4. Report: "Resolved 5 comments, updated 3 files"
```

### Example 2: Collaborative + Sequential

```markdown
Task: Address review comments collaboratively, one at a time

Execution:
1. Fetch 3 unresolved comments
2. Show comment 1, get user input, apply change, resolve
3. Repeat for each comment in order
4. Show summary, push changes
```

## Output Format

### YOLO Mode Output

```markdown
TASK: Resolve PR Comments (#42)
STATUS: Complete

COMMENTS ADDRESSED: 8/8
- 5 required code changes
- 2 clarifications
- 1 acknowledgment

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/auth.ts (2 changes)
- src/api.ts (1 change)
- src/utils.ts (2 changes)

THREADS RESOLVED: 8
CHANGES PUSHED: Yes
CI STATUS: Passing
```

### Collaborative Mode Output

```plaintext
PR Comment Resolution Progress

✅ Comment 1/8 - "Add error handling" - Resolved
✅ Comment 2/8 - "Fix typo" - Resolved  
⏳ Comment 3/8 - "Refactor function" - In progress

Current: Reviewing proposed refactoring approach
Next: 5 comments remaining
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Conflict with recent changes**
     - Pull latest changes
     - Re-evaluate comment applicability
     - Resolve conflicts if needed

2. **Unclear feedback**
     - YOLO: Make best-effort interpretation, document assumption
     - Collaborative: Ask user for clarification

3. **Comment already addressed**
     - Verify fix is present
     - Reply explaining it's addressed
     - Resolve thread

4. **Tests fail after changes**
     - YOLO: Attempt auto-fix, revert if fails
     - Collaborative: Show failure, ask for guidance

## Best Practices

1. **Process in logical order**: Group related comments, handle dependencies first
2. **Verify before resolving**: Ensure feedback truly addressed
3. **Clear communication**: Explain what was done in thread replies
4. **Test after changes**: Run tests before pushing
5. **Commit logically**: Group related changes in commits
6. **Update PR description**: Reflect significant changes made
7. **Track progress**: Use todo list for multi-comment PRs
8. **Request re-review**: Notify reviewers of significant changes

## Integration Example
