# Comparative Decision Analysis Input Schema

Use this schema with `scripts/score_with_guardrails.py`.
Use `input-schema.json` in this directory as the machine-readable source of truth.

## Required Fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `decision` | string | Decision statement. |
| `criteria_confirmed` | boolean | Must be `true` unless running a one-shot simulation. |
| `criteria_confirmation_source` | enum | Required when `criteria_confirmed=true`; one of `user-confirmed`, `provided-input`, `yolo-mode`. |
| `current_platform` | string | Current platform to optimize. |
| `criteria` | array | Must include full criterion contract fields. |
| `alternatives` | array | Must include at least 2 alternatives for scoring. |
| `independent_evaluations` | array | One isolated evaluator record per alternative. |

## Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `score_scale` | string | `0-100` (`1-5` supported) |
| `major_platforms` | string[] | `["chatgpt","claude","gemini","copilot"]` |
| `weights.major_platform_average` | number | `0.6` |
| `weights.current_platform` | number | `0.4` |
| `recommendation_rules.*` | number | Script defaults |
| `recommendation_rules.min_coverage` | number | `0.8` |
| `independent_evaluations[].evidence_refs` | string[] | `[]` |

## Criterion Contract

Each criterion must include:

- `id`
- `name`
- `weight`
- `metric`
- `data_source`
- `scoring_rule`

## Alternative Contract

Each alternative must include:

- `id`
- `name`
- `effort` (`S|M|L`)
- `risk` (`Low|Med|Medium|High`)
- `feasible` (`true|false`)
- `scores` (platform -> criterion -> numeric score or `null`)
- `justification` (explicit option-level rationale)

## Independent Evaluation Contract

Each independent evaluation record must include:

- `alternative_id` (must match exactly one alternative `id`)
- `evaluator_id` (must be unique across all alternatives)
- `isolation_confirmed` (must be `true`)
- `summary` (concise isolated finding summary)
- `evidence_refs` (optional array of evidence pointers)

## Missing Evidence

- Use `null` for missing criterion scores.
- Missing values are excluded from weighted averages.
- Coverage is computed and used for recommendation gating.
