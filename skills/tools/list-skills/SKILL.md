## Implementation Notes

- This skill dynamically enumerates all SKILL.md files in the workspace.
- For LLM agents, returning a Markdown table or JSON array is recommended for easy parsing.
- For human users, a Markdown table is most readable.

## Quick Reference

- List all skills: `list-skills`
- List skills by category: `list-skills --category workflow`
- Output as JSON: `list-skills --format json`
