# Update Work Item

## Overview

Update progress on an existing work item: change status, record actual effort, add test results, mark related commits, validate dependencies, and add implementation notes as work progresses.

## When to Use

Update a work item when:

- Starting work (change status to `in-progress`)
- Completing implementation (change status to `ready-for-review`)
- Recording actual hours spent
- Adding related commit hashes
- Logging test results or CI status
- Adjusting estimates based on new information
- Adding implementation notes or blockers
- Validating dependencies before closing

## When NOT to Use

Skip updates for:

- Creating new items (use `create-work-item` skill)
- Finalizing and archiving (use `finalize-work-item` skill)
- Minor comments (just edit as needed, no skill required)

## Frontmatter Fields

### Status and Status Reason Fields

```yaml
status: proposed | ready | in-progress | ready-for-review | closed
status_reason: null | success | obsolete | redundant | superseded | cancelled
```

| Status             | status_reason | Meaning                              | When to Use                       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `proposed`         | (none)        | Work item proposed but not yet ready | Initial creation                  |
| `ready`            | (none)        | Work item ready to start             | Prior to in-progress              |
| `in-progress`      | (none)        | Active development                   | Actively working                  |
| `ready-for-review` | (none)        | Impl done, awaiting review/tests     | Tests running, PR submitted       |
| `closed`           | `success`     | Finished successfully                | All criteria met, merged          |
| `closed`           | `obsolete`    | No longer relevant                   | Market changed, approach outdated |
| `closed`           | `redundant`   | Duplicate item                       | Same work in another item         |
| `closed`           | `superseded`  | Made moot by other item              | Different item solves it better   |
| `closed`           | `cancelled`   | Work stopped                         | Stopped, won't implement          |

**Important**: Before transitioning to `closed`, validate that all items in `links.depends_on` are already in `closed` status.

### Effort Tracking

```yaml
estimated: 20 # Set when created (hours as decimal)
actual: 18 # Update as work progresses, finalize when complete
completed_date: null # Set when status = closed (YYYY-MM-DD format)
```

**Guidelines**:

- `estimated`: Set once, don't change unless scope significantly shifts
- `actual`: Start as `null`, update when complete
- `completed_date`: Set only when moving to closed status

### Commit Tracking

```yaml
commits:
  6d8c044: 'feat(sdk): initial FilterAdapter interface'
  f00459b: 'feat(filters): implement selectattr and map'
  a1b2c3d: 'docs: add filter usage examples'
```

Record commit SHAs (7+ character hashes or 40-character full hashes) mapped to their commit messages. Helps trace implementation back to work items.

To get commit message:

```bash
git log <short_hash> -n 1 --pretty=format:"%s"
```

### Test Results

```yaml
test_results:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
    note: 'https://github.com/squirrel289/temple/actions/runs/12345678'
```

Record test results with timestamps:

```yaml
test_results:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
    note: 'All 47 tests pass, coverage 89%'
  - timestamp: 2024-06-02T10:00:00Z
    note: '3 test failures in test_renderer.py (see PR comments)'
```

### Dependencies

```yaml
links:
  depends_on:
    - '[[wi-054_complete_temple_native.md]]'
    - '[[wi-043_implement_template_syntax_validation.md]]'
```

Update if new dependencies emerge during implementation. **Critical**: Before closing a work item, verify all items in `links.depends_on` are already `closed`.

## Workflow: Updating Work Items

### 1. Moving to In-Progress

When starting work (changing status from `proposed` or `ready` to `in-progress`):

1. **If executing multiple work items in parallel**, use `parallel-execution` skill to ensure workspace isolation: one git worktree per WI with main agent handling all git/PR operations and subagents implementing code only.

2. **Automatically create and checkout a local feature branch** via `feature-branch-management` skill:

   ```bash
   # Triggered automatically when status: in-progress
   feature-branch-management create feature/wi-060
   ```

   - Branch naming convention: `feature/wi-<id>` (e.g., `feature/wi-060`)
   - Branch is created from main and checked out automatically
   - If the branch already exists, it is checked out
   - This ensures all work is isolated and traceable to the work item

3. **Validate branch state** via `guarding-branches` aspect before first commit:
   - Confirm you're on the correct feature branch
   - Verify no untracked files or uncommitted changes from previous work
   - Run `git clean -n` to preview cleanup if needed

4. Update the work item file frontmatter:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: 'Implement FilterAdapter'
   id: 'wi-060'
   status: in-progress
   priority: high
   estimated: 20
   actual: 2
   completed_date: null
   status_reason: null
   notes:
     - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
       note: |
         Started implementation of FilterAdapter in packages/core/.
         Initial focus: selectattr and map filters.
   ---
   ```

5. Update `actual` as work progresses:
   ```yaml
   actual: 5 # Increment as work progresses, use decimals (e.g., 5.5 for 5h 30m)
   ```

### 2. Recording Actual Hours

As work progresses, update `actual`:

```yaml
estimated: 20
actual: 6 # 2 hours initial + 4 more hours
```

Update periodically (after major milestones, at end of session) so you have a sense of actual time investment.

### 3. Adding Related Commits

When work is committed, record the commit SHA and message:

```yaml
commits:
  6d8c044: 'feat(sdk): FilterAdapter interface'
  f00459b: 'feat(filters): selectattr and map'
  a1b2c3d: 'docs: add filter usage examples'
```

Use short (7-character) or full (40-character) hashes as keys, with commit subject as the value.

Keep hashes in chronological order. Multiple commits are fine—they show the evolution of the work.

### 4. Transitioning to Ready-for-Review

When implementation is done and ready for review, move to ready-for-review:

1. **Validate all changes** via `validating-changes` skill:
   - Run local CI tests: `pnpm test:affected:ci`
   - If tests fail, add regression tests and fix code, then re-run until all pass
   - Verify no unintended file deletions: `git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-status | grep '^D'` (should return nothing)
   - Confirm only files related to this WI are modified

2. **Validate branch state** via `guarding-branches` aspect:
   - Verify no untracked files: `git status --porcelain | grep "^??"` (should return nothing)
   - Confirm no uncommitted changes: `git status` (working tree clean)
   - Verify branch contains only atomic, WI-scoped commits

3. **Sync branch with main** via `feature-branch-management`:

   ```bash
   # Triggered automatically when status: ready-for-review
   feature-branch-management sync --base=main
   ```

   - Rebases feature branch on latest main to avoid conflicts
   - Ensures clean commit history for PR review
   - If conflicts detected, will prompt with suggested resolution steps

4. **Create Pull Request** via `create-pr` skill (automatic):

   ```bash
   # Triggered automatically when status: ready-for-review
   create-pr work_item=wi-060
   ```

   - PR title auto-generated: "wi-060: Implement FilterAdapter"
   - PR description auto-generated from work item notes + commit history
   - PR links to work item via "Closes wi-060" reference
   - PR URL recorded in work item metadata

5. **Update work item frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   status: ready-for-review
   actual: 18 # Finalize effort
   status_reason: null
   links:
     pull_requests:
       - 'https://github.com/templjs/templjs/pull/247'
   notes:
     - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
       note: |
         Implementation complete. All filters implemented with type signatures.
         PR submitted for review: #247
         Awaiting code review and approval.
   ```

Do NOT set `completed_date` or `status_reason` yet.

### 5. Recording Test Results

After running tests:

```yaml
status: ready-for-review
test_results:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
    note: 'https://github.com/templjs/templjs/actions/runs/98765432'
  - timestamp: 2024-06-02T08:00:00Z
    note: |
      CI results:
      - 98 tests pass
      - 2 tests fail in test_filter_edge_cases.py (filter_args validation)
      - Coverage 87% (target 85%)

      Known issues:
      - Filter arg validation too strict for varargs
      - Will fix in follow-up PR
```

If tests fail, add notes on what needs fixing. Update status back to `in-progress` if rework needed:

```yaml
status: in-progress
actual: 19
test_results:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-02T10:00:00Z
    note: 'Test failures exposed issue with varargs handling. Reworking in feature/wi-060.'
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-02T10:00:00Z
    note: 'Tests exposed issue with varargs handling. Working on fix.'
```

### 6. Moving to Closed

When all tests pass, work is approved, and PR is merged:

1. **Verify dependencies closed**: Before moving to `closed`, check that all items in `links.depends_on` have `status: closed`

2. **Validate branch safety** via `guarding-branches` aspect:
   - Confirm PR is `MERGEABLE` and no branch protection rules are blocking merge
   - If auto-merge is required by branch policy, enable it; otherwise approve and merge manually
   - After merge, perform post-merge validation: run CI tests and verify no regressions

3. **Update work item frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   status: closed
   status_reason: success
   actual: 22
   completed_date: 2026-02-12
   test_results:
     - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
       note: 'https://github.com/templjs/templjs/actions/runs/98765432'
   links:
     pull_requests:
       - 'https://github.com/templjs/templjs/pull/247'
   commits:
     a1b2c3d: 'chore: merge PR #247 (FilterAdapter implementation)'
   notes:
     - timestamp: 2024-06-02T15:00:00Z
       note: |
         All acceptance criteria met:
         - FilterAdapter interface implemented and documented
         - Core filters (selectattr, map, join, default) working
         - 95% test coverage
         - Code reviewed and approved
         - Merged to main
   ```

Set `status_reason` to one of:

- `success`: Normal completion with acceptance criteria met
- `obsolete`: Item no longer needed (note why in notes)
- `redundant`: Duplicate of another item (reference it via links)
- `superseded`: Made moot by another item (reference it via links)
- `cancelled`: Work stopped before completion (note why in notes)

Leave file in `/backlog/`. The `finalize-work-item` skill handles archiving to `/backlog/archive/`.

### 7. Adjusting Estimates

If scope changes significantly during work:

```yaml
estimated: 28 # Increased from 20 due to validation requirements
actual: 14
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
    note: |
      Scope expanded: discovered need for JSON Schema validation in filter 
      arguments. Adjusted estimate by +8 hours.
```

Or revert the work item to `proposed` if scope change is fundamental:

```yaml
status: proposed
estimated: 28
actual: 14
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
    note: 'Scope significantly expanded. Reverting to proposed for re-estimation.'
```

### 8. Updating Dependencies

If new dependencies discovered during work:

```yaml
links:
  depends_on:
    - '[[wi-054_complete_temple_native.md]]'
    - '[[wi-044_implement_semantic_validation.md]]' # Added: type checking needed
```

Update the work item file to reflect these. Document in notes why the dependency was added.

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Work Progress

**Initial creation** (status: proposed):

```yaml
---
title: 'Implement FilterAdapter'
id: 'wi-060'
status: proposed

    note: |
      Merged to main. All acceptance criteria met.
      Ready for finalization.
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix with Rework

**Starting work**:

```yaml
---
title: 'Fix elif parsing edge case'
id: 'wi-059'
status: in-progress
estimated: 4
actual: 1
---
```

**Test failure (rework needed)**:

```yaml
status: in-progress
actual: 3
test_results:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T10:00:00Z
    note: 'Local: 1 test fails in test_parser.py::test_consecutive_elif'
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T10:00:00Z
    note: |
      Found deeper issue: elif blocks interfere when nested.
      Need to refactor block termination logic.
      Revising approach—effort may exceed estimate.
```

**Resolution (ready-for-review)**:

```yaml
status: ready-for-review
actual: 7
estimated: 4
commits:
  abc1234: 'fix(parser): elif block termination logic'
test_results:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T14:00:00Z
    note: 'https://github.com/templjs/templjs/actions/runs/87654321'
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T14:00:00Z
    note: |
      Fixed by refactoring block_ends() logic. Took longer due to edge cases.
      All tests now pass including new consecutive_elif tests.
      PR submitted for review.
```

### Example 3: Spike/Research Update

```yaml
---
title: 'Evaluate expression engines'
id: 'wi-061'
status: in-progress
estimated: 16
actual: 8
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T08:00:00Z
    note: |
      Evaluation candidates:
      1. JMESPath - mature, good for JSON, limited type support
      2. Custom recursive descent - flexible, small footprint
      3. meval - lightweight Python evaluator

      Progress:
      - JMESPath prototype working (2h)
      - Custom parser WIP (6h) - complexity clear now, drafting comparison doc

      Leaning toward option 2 (custom) due to control of type system.

```

## Tips & Conventions

### Atomic Updates

Each update should correspond to a logical work milestone:

- End of session: time tracking
- After tests run: test results
- After commit: commit hash
- Status change: full progress summary

Don't update work items excessively—focus on meaningful changes.

### Notes Field

Use `notes` for:

- Progress summary
- Blockers or issues
- Scope changes
- Decision points
- Follow-up items

Avoid: detailed implementation notes (keep in commit messages instead)

### Time Tracking Accuracy

Record hours regularly:

- At end of each session
- After significant milestone
- Final tally when completed

Use decimals for partial hours (e.g., `5.5` for 5 hours 30 minutes).

### Commit Message Integration

Reference work items in commit messages:

```
feat(filters): implement selectattr and map

Implements core filtering operations for FilterAdapter.
Supports filtering sequences by attribute value and projection.

Closes wi-60
See backlog/wi-060_implement_filter_adapter.md
```

Then update the work item with the commit hash.

### Dependency Validation

Before marking a work item as `closed`:

1. Check the `links.depends_on` section
2. Verify each referenced work item has `status: closed`
3. If any `depends_on` items are not closed, leave this item at `ready-for-review` with a note explaining what's blocking closure

Example:

```yaml
status: ready-for-review
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-02T15:00:00Z
    note: |
      Implementation complete and tested. Awaiting closure of:
      - [[wi-054_complete_temple_native.md]] (currently in-progress)
      - [[wi-043_implement_syntax_validation.md]] (currently ready-for-review)

      Ready to move to closed once dependencies are resolved.
```

## Common Patterns

### Weekly Status Update

Review active work items weekly:

```yaml
status: in-progress
actual: 12 # Update from 10
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-08T17:00:00Z
    note: |
      Week of Feb 10: 2 hours progress (mid-week catchup).
      Current blockers: Decision on filter signature format—waiting for architecture review.
      Expected completion: Feb 17
```

### Handling Blockers

```yaml
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T14:00:00Z
    note: |
      BLOCKED: Waiting for ADR-006 decision on expression language.
      Cannot finalize filter syntax without it.
      Unblocked when: ADR merged and decision published
      Impact: Pushed completion target to 2026-02-20
```

### Scope Creep Recognition

```yaml
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T14:00:00Z
    note: |
      Original estimate: 12 hours (selectattr, map, join)
      Current scope: +default filter + type validation = ~18 hours likely
      Recommendation: Create follow-up item for advanced filters, limit this to core 3.
```
