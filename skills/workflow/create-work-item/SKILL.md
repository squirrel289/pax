# Create Work Item

## Overview

Create a new work item (backlog entry) in `/backlog/` with consistent structure, YAML metadata, and conventions. Work items track features, bugs, spikes, and tasks with clear goals, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

## When to Use

Create a work item when:

- Starting a new feature, spike, or task
- Documenting a well-scoped request or bug
- Breaking down larger epics into tracked subtasks
- Proposing architectural changes or experiments
- Establishing clear success criteria before implementation

## When NOT to Use

Skip work items for:

- Trivial one-off fixes (can be done directly)
- Exploratory work without clear scope (start with spike first)
- Time-critical hotfixes (commit directly, backlog after)
- Duplicate items (update existing instead, see `update-work-item` skill)

## Work Item Lifecycle

```
Created (not_started)
    ↓
Implementation (in_progress)
    ↓
Review + Testing (testing)
    ↓
Completed (completed)
    ↓
Archived (to archive/)
```

## Backlog Structure

**Directory**: `/backlog/` (current items) or `/backlog/archive/` (completed/superseded)

**Naming Convention**: `<number>_<slug>.md` where:
- `<number>`: Sequential integer (e.g., 54, 55, 56)
- `<slug>`: Kebab-case description (e.g., `complete_temple_native`, `implement_adapter_spec`)

**Numbering**: Continue from highest existing number in `/backlog/` (not archive)

## File Structure

### 1. YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Human-readable work item title"
id: <number>
status: not_started | in_progress | testing | completed
state_reason: null  # Set only when status = completed (success | obsolete | redundant | superseded | cancelled)
priority: low | medium | high | critical
complexity: low | medium | high
estimated_hours: <number>
actual_hours: null  # Set when completed
completed_date: null  # Set when completed
related_commit: []  # Array of commit hashes/refs
test_results: null  # URL or description of test results
dependencies:
  - "[[<other_item_number>_<slug>.md]]"
related_backlog:
  - "archive/<number>_<slug>.md"
related_spike:
  - "archive/<number>_<slug>.md"
notes: |
  Optional additional context or implementation notes
---
```

### 2. Content Sections

```markdown
## Goal

One-paragraph summary of what this work item achieves. Answer: "What is the end state?"

## Background

Context, motivation, or prior work. Answer: "Why are we doing this?"

## Tasks

Numbered list of implementation steps or subtasks:

1. **Task Name**: Brief description
   - Sub-point if needed
   - Code example if helpful

2. **Next Task**: Description

## Deliverables

What artifacts or code changes will result:

- New file/module: `path/to/file.py`
- Modified behavior: "CLI now accepts --flag"
- Documentation: "Updated architecture guide"

## Acceptance Criteria

Clear, verifiable markers of completion:

- [ ] All new tests pass (test_*.py)
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] Documented in docs/ (README or ADR)
- [ ] Reviewed and merged to main
```

## Workflow: Creating a Work Item

### 1. Determine Next ID

- Check highest numbered file in `/backlog/` (not archive)
- Next ID = max existing + 1

Example: If `56_jinja2_adapter_prototype.md` is highest, next = `57_*`

### 2. Draft Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Implementation feature name"
id: 57
status: not_started
state_reason: null
priority: high  # or medium/low/critical
complexity: medium  # or low/high
estimated_hours: 24
actual_hours: null
completed_date: null
related_commit: []
test_results: null
dependencies:
  - "[[54_complete_temple_native.md]]"  # Links to other work items
related_backlog:
  - "archive/06_rendering_engine.md"  # If refining prior work
notes: |
  Any additional context or decision points
---
```

**Status Values**:
- `not_started`: Ready to begin
- `in_progress`: Active work
- `testing`: Implementation done, awaiting review/test results
- `completed`: Finished (may have different reasons—see `state_reason`)

**state_reason** (used only when `status: completed`):
- `success`: Work completed successfully, all criteria met
- `obsolete`: Item no longer relevant (market/approach changed)
- `redundant`: Duplicate of another work item
- `superseded`: Made moot by another item (note which one)
- `cancelled`: Work stopped, won't implement (note why)

**Priority**:
- `low`: Nice-to-have, can be deferred
- `medium`: Standard work item
- `high`: Important, plan next
- `critical`: Blocking other work

**Complexity**:
- `low`: ≤6 hours, isolated change
- `medium`: 6-20 hours, affects multiple areas
- `high`: 20+ hours, architectural or cross-cutting

### 3. Write Goal Section

One sentence to one paragraph:

```markdown
## Goal

Implement `FilterAdapter` interface in the core temple package to provide built-in filters for data transformation: `selectattr`, `map`, `join`, `default`, with type annotations.
```

### 4. Add Context Sections

**Background**: Why this matters, prior decisions, linked research

```markdown
## Background

Filter support is required for ADR-003 (adapter architecture). Current prototype has hardcoded filter logic; ADR-005 proposes a pluggable FilterAdapter contract. This work implements the concrete contract in `temple/sdk/adapter.py` with 4 core filters and test coverage.
```

**Tasks**: Numbered, actionable steps

```markdown
## Tasks

1. **Design FilterAdapter contract**
   - Extend `temple/sdk/adapter.py` with `FilterAdapter` class
   - Define `apply(input: Any, filter_name: str, args: List) -> Any`
   - Create `FilterSignature` with type hints

2. **Implement core filters in FilterRegistry**
   - `selectattr(objects, attr, value)` → List[T] where T.attr == value
   - `map(objects, attr)` → List[extracted]
   - `join(items, separator)` → str
   - `default(value, fallback)` → value if truthy else fallback

3. **Add type annotations and validation**
   - Each filter registers `FilterSignature` with parameter types
   - Validate filter arguments at parse time

4. **Write unit and integration tests**
   - Test each filter behavior
   - Test error cases (type mismatches, missing attributes)
```

### 5. Add Deliverables

```markdown
## Deliverables

- `temple/sdk/adapter.py` extended with `FilterAdapter` and `FilterSignature`
- `temple/sdk/filters.py` with core filter implementations
- Unit tests in `tests/test_filters.py` (>80% coverage)
- Integration test in `tests/test_renderer_filters.py`
- Updated API docs in `docs/ADAPTER_SPEC.md`
```

### 6. Add Acceptance Criteria

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All filter functions are type-annotated and pass mypy
- [ ] 100% of filter branches tested (unit + integration)
- [ ] Filters integrate seamlessly with renderer
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Merged to main branch
- [ ] Release notes updated
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Work Item

```yaml
---
title: "Implement JSON Schema validation in template linter"
id: 57
status: not_started
priority: high
complexity: high
estimated_hours: 20
dependencies:
  - "[[54_complete_temple_native.md]]"
  - "[[44_implement_semantic_validation.md]]"
---

## Goal

Add JSON Schema validation to `temple-linter` to catch schema violations in templates at lint time, catching type mismatches and missing required fields before runtime.

...
```

### Example 2: Spike/Research Work Item

```yaml
---
title: "Evaluate expression engine alternatives for complex filters"
id: 58
status: not_started
priority: medium
complexity: medium
estimated_hours: 16
notes: |
  Spike to evaluate JMESPath vs. custom expression engine for advanced filters.
  Decision will inform ADR-006 (expression language).
---

## Goal

Research and document three expression engine approaches for advanced data filtering in templates, with proof-of-concept for each.

...
```

### Example 3: Bug/Fix Work Item

```yaml
---
title: "Fix elif grammar parsing edge case"
id: 59
status: not_started
priority: high
complexity: low
estimated_hours: 4
dependencies:
  - "[[54_complete_temple_native.md]]"
---

## Goal

Fix parser to correctly handle consecutive `{% elif %}` blocks without requiring `{% else %}` at the end.

## Tasks

1. Add test case for multiple elif without else
2. Update grammar in `token_parser.py`
3. Verify fixture tests pass

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Edge case test passes
- [ ] No regression in existing tests
- [ ] Merged to main
```

## Tips & Conventions

### Dependency Linking

Link to related work items using `[[filename]]` syntax:

```markdown
dependencies:
  - "[[54_complete_temple_native.md]]"
  - "[[43_implement_template_syntax_validation.md]]"
```

The double-bracket syntax creates wiki-link references that tools can parse.

### Commit Tracking

Record commits that implement this work:

```yaml
related_commit:
  - 6d8c044  # feat(parser): canonicalize control-flow end tokens
  - f00459b  # fix(renderer): handle filter signature validation
```

Add these incrementally as work progresses, then complete the item.

### Effort Estimation

Use fibonacci-like estimates:

- 1-2 hours: Trivial fixes
- 4-6 hours: Small feature or bug
- 8-12 hours: Medium feature
- 16-24 hours: Large feature
- 32+ hours: Epic or major refactor

### Positioning in Backlog

Not all work needs an item:

- **Skip for**: Inline changes, trivial docs fixes, emergency hotfixes
- **Create for**: Features, spikes, architectural changes, tracked bugs

When in doubt, create the item—it's easier to abandon than to recreate.

### Archiving

When a work item is completed:

1. Move file from `/backlog/` to `/backlog/archive/`
2. Set `completed_date: YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Ensure `actual_hours` is recorded
4. Document `related_commit` with all implementation commits

Example: After completing #57, move `57_implement_json_schema_validation.md` to `archive/57_implement_json_schema_validation.md`
